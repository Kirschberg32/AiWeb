        <h2> Hints </h2>
        To be able to make a better guess, you can get 3 hints before making your final guess and 'reveal' the solution. They are 'hyperplane', 'distance' and 'quadrant'. You can use each of them exactly one time. To ask for a hint simply type the name of the hint with the coordinates of a point in the same message separated by a space, as each hint depends on a point (Example: <b>'1 1 hyperplane'</b>).
        <br><b>'hyperplane':</b> Imagine a straight line through your entered point and the origin (0,0). This is the hyperplane. Your hint will be whether the searched point is located on this line, or in the y dimension above or below the line. 
        <br><b>'distance':</b> You will get information about whether the point to guess is less or more than max_value / 3 away from your entered point. 
        <br><b>'quadrant':</b> You will get the information if your entered point is located in the same quadrant of the coordinate system as the point to guess. If it is, this means, that both coordinates of the point to guess have the same signs as the ones from your entered point. 
        
        <br><br>After getting all the hints you want, you can make a final guess. If you want you can send it in the chat simply by sending two numbers separated by a space (<b>'3 3'</b>). If you are done guessing you can reveal the correct point by typing <b>'reveal'</b>. The closest guess wins.
